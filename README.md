Build of Builds
===============

This is the repository for the phase 3 demo software and build support. The scripts directory contains everything needed to compile the demo.

To do a full install run the `bootstrap.sh` script in a freshly installed Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit server with at least 50gb of hard-drive space. The script will download this repository and kick off the main build.

If you already have this repository checked out then you can execute `main.sh` to install all the software dependencies for this project, check out all the code, and build the final images.
